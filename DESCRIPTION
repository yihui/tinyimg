Description: Optimize and compress images using 'Rust' libraries to reduce
    file sizes while maintaining image quality. Currently supports lossless
    PNG optimization via the 'oxipng' crate. The package provides functions to
    optimize individual image files or entire directories, with configurable
    compression levels to balance between file size reduction and processing speed.
